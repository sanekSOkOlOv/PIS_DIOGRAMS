## Using this Repository
You can explore the different diagrams by opening the corresponding files in their respective directories. Each diagram is presented as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG), which can be viewed directly in your web browser.

If you wish to edit or modify the diagrams, you can use appropriate software tools that support the specific diagram types. Feel free to clone this repository and make the necessary changes locally. (https://app.diagrams.net/)
